<p class = "opening">My name is <b>Robert Fox</b> and I am <i>25 years old</i>. I was born in Waterford and have lived here for most of my life. I went to Ballygunner National School, and De La Salle College for secondary school. My hobbies include swimming, MMA, rugby; and gaming as well as others such as music and film.
I have returned to education as a mature student in W.I.T for the first time since 2012. After finishing my leaving cert in 2011, I went onto third level education in D.I.T studying Electronic & Communication Engineering.
<br>
After an unsuccessful year I chose to pursue work and travel instead. In the years since I have worked in a variety of roles including being self-employed, a call centre agent and various other labouring roles. In 2015 I achieved my goal of moving to another country and settling there to work.
<br>
I obtained a 2 year working visa for Canada in 2015 and moved to Toronto, where I stayed for 2 years mostly working in the construction industry. San Francisco was the next destination in 2017, where I stayed for a couple of months, primarily working in the moving/storage industry. Since returning to Ireland in July 2018, I have had some work in the construction industry once again.
It has always been my goal to return to education and I am delighted and grateful to be given an opportunity as good as the one I have received from W.I.T.
I am always willing to try to learn something new and I will give it my 100% best effort.</p>
